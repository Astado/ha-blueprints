This is a comprehensive and highly configurable blueprint that can be used for the following basic purposes:

* Automatic opening and closing the roller shutters
* Freely configurable time windows for opening or closing
* Brightness control and/or control via the sun-elevation
* The use of scheduler helpers are possible
* Ventilation feature (Currently for two-way sensors)
* Resident feature: keep the cover closed if resident is asleep
* Complete flexibility in almost all parameters (drive delays, waiting times, position tolerance)
  - Fixed drive delay and random drive delay
  - Waiting time duration for triggers
  - Position tolerance
* Each feature can be activated or deactivated as required
* Dynamic conditions possible
* Extensive automatic sun shading with many different setting options
* Added the option to save the current status in a helper. This has the advantage that the cover can also be in other positions and the automation can still be executed. And manual interventions are not constantly overridden with every trigger.


*This was originally a fork of Eimeel's blueprint [automatic_blinds_shading.yaml](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/extensive-roller-shutter-control-including-shading-brightness-sun-position-temperature-forecast/613715).*
*Note: My blueprint is not compatible with Eimeel's original. I have used his basis, but my variables are completely different from his design.*


## Condition examples
 - If, for example, your blinds on the upper floor only close automatically and are not opened via the automation, you can also enable the blinds to be opened during this time by activating a vacation mode boolean.
- If you have visitors or a party, you may not want the blinds to close. This can be easily configured using a party mode boolean.
- If, for any reason, you want to pause the activation of shading or the ending of shading, this can be controlled via a shading boolean.
- If you want to suspend the entire roller blind control for a short time, perhaps because maintenance work or window cleaning is being carried out, this is possible with just one boolean.
- Are the roller blinds on side doors normally only opened by the automation system and never closed because you don't want to lock yourself out? But on vacation, the blinds should still be closed. This is how the conditions work.

## Shading features
- Sun azimuth
- Sun elevation
- Solar irradiation/Light intensity/Illuminance
- Weather Conditions
- Two different temperature sensors (compare thresholds for indoor and/or outdoor sensors)
- Not only the current temperature, but also the temperature forecast can also be taken into account.
- If multiple criteria (e.g. temperature sensors and/or azimuth and/or elevation) are defined, shading will not occur until <ins>all</ins> criteria are met.

## Important notes
- It is **not** possible to execute this automation manually!
- If you want to use sun elevation and/or azimuth it's strongly advised to use sun.sun. And please make sure your sun.sun entity is enabled!
- `time_up_early` should be earlier `than time_up_late`
- `time_up_early_non_workday` should be earlier than `time_up_late_non_workday`
- `time_down_early` should be earlier than `time_down_late`
- `time_down_early_non_workday` should be earlier than `time_down_late_non_workday`
- `shading_azimuth_start` should be lower than `shading_azimuth_end`
- `shading_elevation_min` should be lower than `shading_elevation_max`
- `shading_sun_brightness_start` should be higher than `shading_sun_brightness_end`
- `open_position` should be higher than `closed_position`
- `open_position` should be higher than `ventilate_position`
- `closed_position` should be lower than `ventilate_position`
- `shading_cover_position` should be higher than `closed_position`
- `shading_cover_position` should be lower than `open_position`
- `resident_sensor` is only allowed to be on/off/true/false
- cover must have a `current_position` attribute
- After manual creation in the GUI, the helper is filled with standard content on the <ins>first trigger</ins>. In rare cases, this may mean that the first trigger does not move the blinds. This may take care of itself a few minutes later. The next day at the latest.

# Why did I fork the original or what are the differences to the Eimeel blueprint?
- Icons-Updates
- Streamline variables
- Complete GUI optimization
- Added sun elevation feature: Sun control for up/down
- Added waiting time duration for sensors
- Added fixed/random drive delays
- Added several condition selectors: Useful to be able to check various conditions such as party mode or similar when opening, closing, shading, etc.
- Closing after shading just when position is lower than before
- Added the possibility that the previous position did not necessarily have to be controlled by the automation.
- Added optional Cover Status Helper
- Try to recognize manual drives
