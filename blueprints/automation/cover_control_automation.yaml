    # Cover Control Automation (CCA)

    **Version: 2024.01.14**

    This is a comprehensive blueprint that can be used for the following basic purposes:
      - Opening and closing the roller shutters (depending on brightness, sun-elevation and within time windows)
      - Extensive automatic sun shading


    <details>


    *This was originally a fork of Eimeel's blueprint [automatic_blinds_shading.yaml](https://gist.github.com/jmerifjKriwe/bffbc7424dd04f4a31d6a71f7012cd1f) and is largely based on his programming.*<br />

    **NOTES**

    - It is not possible to execute this automation manually!
    - In order to have extensive flexibility here, different sensors are used. But there is also the possibility to define an occupant of the room,
      so that e.g. the roller shutter does not go up in the morning, although the occupant is still sleeping.
    - The automation only moves the roller shutter if it is positioned at one of the defined positions
      (ventilate position, shading position, open position or closed position). Otherwise, the roller shutter has been moved manually.
      After a manual movement, it is unclear what is intended to be achieved, so the automation no longer takes action.
      To automate the movement of the roller shutter again, it must be moved to one of the defined positions beforehand.

  #  Synced with version 2024010301 of the origin

  # Differences to the Eimeel blueprint:
  # - Icons-Updates
  # - Streamline variables
  # - Some GUI-changes
  # - Added sun elevation feature: Sun control for up/down
  # - Added waiting time duration for sensors
  # - Added fixed/random drive delays
  # - Added external shading state sensor. Will probably be removed again.
  # - Added several condition selectors: Useful to be able to check various conditions such as party mode or similar when opening, closing, shading, etc.

  # Notes / Planned modifications:
  # - see also TODOs in code
  # - possibly also drive down if not in the correct position
  # - Only move to the target position if it is below the shading position and the shading is currently on or has been on? Check whether complete.
  # - Check external Shading State Sensor in more conditions?
  # - Hotdaycheck: Forecast and not just current temperature
  # - Low priority: Check if cover  was moved manually. Should I correct the position after a longer wating time? Not sure.
