    # Cover Control Automation (CCA)

    **Version: 2024.01.27** / hvorragend

    This is a comprehensive and highly configurable blueprint that can be used for the following basic purposes:
    - Opening and closing the roller shutters (depending on brightness, <ins>sun-elevation</ins> and within time windows)
    - Ventilation feature (Currently for two-way sensors)
    - Resident feature: keep the cover closed if resident is asleep
    - Complete flexibility in almost all parameters (drive delays, waiting times, position tolerance)
    - Each feature can be activated or deactivated as required. Not only through a switch in the blueprint, but also through dynamic conditions outside the automation (see examples in `Details`).
    - Extensive automatic sun shading with many different setting options (see features in `Details`).
    - Added the option to save the current status in a helper. This has the advantage that the roller blind can also be in other positions and the automation can still be executed. And manual interventions are not constantly overridden with every trigger.

    <details>

    *This was originally a fork of Eimeel's blueprint [automatic_blinds_shading.yaml](https://gist.github.com/jmerifjKriwe/bffbc7424dd04f4a31d6a71f7012cd1f) and is largely based on his programming.*
    Note: My blueprint is not compatible with Eimeel's variant. I have used his basis, but the variables are completely different from his design.<br />

    **Condition examples**
    - If, for example, your blinds on the upper floor only close automatically and are not opened via the automation, you can also enable the blinds to be opened during this time by activating a vacation mode boolean.
    - If you have visitors or a party, you may not want the blinds to close. This can be easily configured using a party mode boolean.
    - If, for any reason, you want to pause the activation of shading or the ending of shading, this can be controlled via a shading boolean.
    - If you want to suspend the entire roller blind control for a short time, perhaps because maintenance work or window cleaning is being carried out, this is possible with just one boolean.
    - Are the roller blinds on side doors normally only opened by the automation system and never closed because you don't want to lock yourself out? But on vacation, the blinds should still be closed. This is how the conditions work.

    **Shading features**
    - Sun azimuth
    - Sun elevation
    - Solar irradiation/Light intensity/Illuminance
    - Weather Conditions
    - Two different temperature sensors (compare thresholds for indoor and/or outdoor sensors)
    - Not only the current temperature, but also the temperature forecast can also be taken into account.
    - If multiple criteria (e.g. temperature sensors and/or azimuth and/or elevation) are defined, shading will not occur until <ins>all</ins> criteria are met.

    **Important notes**
    - It is <ins>not</ins> possible to execute this automation manually!
    - If you want to use sun elevation and/or azimuth it's strongly advised to use sun.sun. And please make sure your sun.sun entity is enabled!
    - `time_up_early` should be earlier `than time_up_late`
    - `time_up_early_non_workday` should be earlier than `time_up_late`
    - `time_down_early` should be earlier than `time_down_late`
    - `shading_azimuth_start` should be lower than `shading_azimuth_end`
    - `shading_elevation_min` should be lower than `shading_elevation_max`
    - `shading_sun_brightness_start` should be higher than `shading_sun_brightness_end`
    - `open_position` should be higher than `closed_position`
    - `open_position` should be higher than `ventilate_position`
    - `closed_position` should be lower than `ventilate_position`
    - `shading_cover_position` should be higher than `closed_position`
    - `shading_cover_position` should be lower than `open_position`
    - `resident` is only allowed to be on/off/true/false
    - cover must have a `current_position` attribute

  # Differences to the Eimeel blueprint:
  # - Icons-Updates
  # - Streamline variables
  # - Complete GUI optimization
  # - Added sun elevation feature: Sun control for up/down
  # - Added waiting time duration for sensors
  # - Added fixed/random drive delays
  # - Added several condition selectors: Useful to be able to check various conditions such as party mode or similar when opening, closing, shading, etc.
  # - Closing after shading just when position is lower than before # TODO
  # - Added the possibility that the previous position did not necessarily have to be controlled by the automation.
  # - Added optional Cover Status Helper
  # - Try to recognize manual drives

  # Notes / Planned modifications:
  # - Hotdaycheck: Forecast and not just current temperature
  # - Shading activate before opening?
  # - Allow shading out if cover is closed? Add another boolean for that?
  # - For Manual detection: Do we need a variable for the drive time of the roller blinds?

      description: |

        - **CHECK THE CURRENT POSITION**
        The automation only moves the cover if it is positioned at one of the defined positions (ventilate position, shading position, open position or closed position). Otherwise, the cover has been moved manually.
        After a manual movement, it is unclear what is intended to be achieved, so the automation no longer takes action.
        To automate the movement of the cover again, it must be moved to one of the defined positions beforehand.
        The advantage of this is that you don't have to create a helper in Home Assistant.

        - **USE AN EXTERNAL HELPER**
        If you want to be able to intervene manually and the automation should execute the next movement as usual, a helper is required.
        *Without helper, the manual override would always be overwritten by the automation.*
        This has the advantage that the roller blind does not necessarily have to be in a defined position.
